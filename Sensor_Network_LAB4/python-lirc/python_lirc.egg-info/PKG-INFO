Description: python-lirc (deprecated)
        ========================
        
        Since Linux 4.18, IR is now handled in-kernel and IR events appear just like
        keyboard or mouse events, making the LIRC daemon and clients (like python-lirc)
        mostly redundant. The new way to configure keymaps is using ir-keytable which
        comes with v4l-utils. See
        https://github.com/tompreston/python-lirc/issues/28#issuecomment-712454662

        Install
        =======
        
            pip3 install python3-lirc
        
        Configure
        =========
        
        You need a valid [lircrc configuration file](http://www.lirc.org/html/configure.html#lircrc_format). For example:
        
            $ cat ~/.lircrc
            begin
              button = 1          # what button is pressed on the remote
              prog = myprogram    # program to handle this command
              config = one, horse # configs are given to program as list
            end
        
            begin
              button = 2
              prog = myprogram
              config = two
            end
        
        Use
        ===
        
            $ python3
            >>> import lirc
            >>> sockid = lirc.init("myprogram")
            >>> lirc.nextcode()  # press 1 on remote after this
            ['one', 'horse']
            >>> lirc.deinit()
        
        Load custom configurations with:
        
            >>> sockid = lirc.init("myprogram", "mylircrc")
            >>> lirc.load_config_file("another-config-file") # subsequent configs
        
        Set whether `nextcode` blocks or not with:
        
            >>> sockid = lirc.init("myprogram", blocking=False)
            >>> lirc.set_blocking(True, sockid)  # or this
        
        
        Building and Installing
        =======================
        If you want to install manually then you may also need to install
        cython and some dev libraries:
        
            sudo apt install cython gcc liblircclient-dev python{,3}-{dev,setuptools}
        
        Download, compile and install for Python 3 and 2.
        
            git clone https://github.com/tompreston/python-lirc.git
            cd python-lirc/
            make py3 && sudo python3 setup.py install
            make py2 && sudo python setup.py install
        
        Development
        ===========
        1. Install the dev libraries as above.
        2. Make changes to `lirc/lirc.pyx`.
        3. Compile with `make py3 && python3 setup.py build`
        4. Test with `python3 tests/tests.py`
